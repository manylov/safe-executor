git clone https://github.com/manylov/safe-executor.git
cd safe-executor
yarn
```

copy .env.example to .env and fill in MAINNET_NODE_URI field

## execute safe queued txs on local fork

`anvil -f https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/... --chain-id 1337`

of

`npx hardhat node`

run scripts in ./scripts folder one by one
`npx hardhat run --network localhost ./scripts/cm-weth/execute.ts`

### Important note !!!

Some scripts do fast-forward of local chain for a few days to pass Timelock ETA requirements.
Several scripts executions can cause chain will have too far blocktime and will not pass Timelock max delay.

So, it's better to restart anvil/hh-node if you need to re-execute txs.
